                  <h4>SKELETON GORGE</h4>
                  Known for its popularity among locals and tourists, Skeleton Gorge is a scenic trek not rivalled by many. Ideal in dry conditions, this hike is great for both the seasoned and novice hiker. During the summer months you’ll be able to get some shade along the Afromontane forest nearly all the way up Skeleton Gorge. Bear in mind that this hike can get quite strenuous so be prepared to really work those muscles, and take the necessary safety precautions.

                  If you are looking for a place featuring multiple activities, then Macassar Dunes Conservation Area is the place for you. With views extending across False Bay, all the way to Kogelberg and Hangklip, the views are as enticing as the “entertainment”. The latter includes wonderful picnic spots, fishing in designated areas (permit required), hiking, swimming and bird watching.

                  <h4>LION’S HEAD</h4>
                  This short summit offers panoramic views of Cape Town and unbeatable sunsets. It’s a popular route to do on nights where there’s a full moon. If you’re relatively fit, you’ll find yourself at the top quite quickly, which is why it’s such a popular after-work hike. There’s a little bit of climbing involved, but there are handholds and chains to help you on your way up and down. You can also take the roundabout way, which skips the climbing part if you are walking with small children or dogs.
